# Frequently Asked Questions

**🤔 Q: Why an independent foundation?**

💁 A: After spending a significant amount of time researching potential umbrella organizations, we decided that our best option was to incorporate an independent entity. Rust is a technology and community that is value driven and we simply didn’t find an organization that we felt was aligned with our community goals. This does mean more work for us, especially upfront, but we think the tradeoff is worth it.

**🤔 Q: Where are we incorporating?**

💁 A: The Rust Foundation will be incorporated as a US 501(c)(6) organization in the state of Delaware. We explored a number of alternatives, including Canada, Switzerland, Belgium, and the EU, but ultimately decided that the US would be our best choice.

The Rust project has contributors and users from all over the world, and one of the pillars of our work has been to ensure Rust keeps being a global project. We consulted leaders of other foundations and our own lawyers, and the conclusion we reached is that no matter where the foundation is located in the world there will always be a subset of people who might have trouble contributing to, interacting with or using Rust.

There is no location that we can incorporate in that would effortlessly make us global by default. We will constantly make sure it represents and includes people from all over the world, not just the US: ensuring a foundation is global is not something we can do at the start and then forget about it, it’s a continuous effort.

**🤔 Q: What is the purpose of the Rust foundation?**

💁 A: The Rust foundation’s purpose is to enable Rust maintainers to do their best work happily. The Rust core team believes that the best Rust will be made by happy maintainers, and focusing the Foundation’s efforts on maintainers will provide for a better Rust for all.

The Foundation’s structure includes active project members on the board who will guide the Foundation’s efforts to best serve the needs of the Rust project.
