# Rust Foundation's 2020 Q&A

Welcome to the 2020 Q&A of the Rust Foundation Project Group!

After this summer's ["Laying the foundation for Rust's future"][aug-blog] blog
post the Rust Foundation Project Group began the work to setup a new home for
the Rust Project. We're getting near the end of the work, and we'd love to
answer all the questions you have on the Rust Foundation!

We welcome everyone to post their questions as [new issues][new], and the team
will do their best to answer them! You can also check [the open issues][issues]
to see what other people asked and the answers to their questions. If you can't
open GitHub issues or want to send questions privately you can send them via
email to <foundation@rust-lang.org>.

⭐️ [**We also have a list of frequently asked questions!**][faq] ⭐️

The members of the Rust Core Team will answer questions from the members of the
Rust Team starting from December 3nd, and will answer questions from the wider
community at the following times:

* Monday December 7th 2020, between XX and YY
* Wednesday December 9th 2020, between XX and YY
* Friday December 11th 2020, between XX and YY
